Loom walkthrough script (1–2 minutes)

0:00 - 0:10 — Quick intro
Hi — I'm Jaydip. This is a short walkthrough of the PAR90 Training Module I built to help branch managers coach CSRs and reduce PAR90.

0:10 - 0:35 — Walk the UI
I open the app and show scenario selection (pick a delinquent customer case). The interface displays the CSR summary and a chat box where the manager types coaching prompts. Each manager message is sent to the backend and the result shows:
- CSR reply (simulated)
- Real-time feedback badge (Good / Needs work)
- Score (0–100) and short rationale

0:35 - 0:55 — Show feedback and improvement
I'll deliberately send a poor coaching message ("Why didn't you call them?") to show the negative feedback and suggestions. Then I'll send an improved coaching message that uses an open question, empathy, and a concrete next step; the score updates and the CSR provides a better commitment.

0:55 - 1:10 — Action plan
I'll click "Generate Action Plan". The app produces a concise 3-step action plan you can take back to your branch (e.g., call schedule, accountability tracker, script prompts).

1:10 - 1:30 — Tech choices and uniqueness
Briefly state tech: Node + Express backend, static frontend, hybrid rule-based + optional OpenAI LLM. Mention unique heuristics in ASSUMPTIONS.md for scoring and coaching patterns.

1:30 - 1:40 — How to run
Close with how to run locally (`cd server && npm install && npm start`) and where to find the README for more detail.

End — thank you and say you're available for a 30-minute debrief.
